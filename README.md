# Robotic Gripper â€“ CAD Design  

This project involves designing and simulating a **robotic gripper arm** using **Fusion 360**. The gripper is actuated by a **servo motor** for precise gripping, while **stepper motors** control the armâ€™s movement. The design is tested using **static stress analysis** to ensure structural integrity.  

## Features  
- **Designed in Fusion 360** with precise constraints.  
- **Servo & Stepper Motor Integration** for controlled movement.  
- **Material Analysis** using PLA for 3D printing.  
- **Static Stress Testing** for durability evaluation.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Optimizing material usage.  
- Adding more degrees of freedom.  
- Using aluminum or fiberglass for improved durability.
